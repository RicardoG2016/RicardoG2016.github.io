            <h4>Opinion</h4>
              <p>For tech savvy individuals the Android may be a better choice because it's most customizable and provides more hardware options. However if you are looking for ease of use and stability then this might not be the choice for you.</p>

              </ul>
            <h4>Opinion</h4>
              <p>Apple's IOS provides stability, stale and predictability for those looking for an easy to use and reliable OS. However, these benefits come with a few drawbacks, mostly the ability to customize the OS and choose from different manufactures. But if you are willing to overlook those drawbacks then IOS is the OS for you.</p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="ios">Final Verdict</h2>
          <p class="text">There is no right or wrong choice. Both these OS's are great and provide different benefits and drawbacks depending on the type of user you are. For those looking for a more customizable OS Android will be favored while those looking for ease of use will lean towards IOS.</p>

      <label id="question">Which OS would you choose?</label> <br>
            <form class="form" action="thank_you_note.html" method="get">
              <input type="radio" name="OS" value="Android">Android
                <br>
              <input type="radio" name="OS" value="IOS">IOS

          <div> I think the <a href="https://www.android.com" >Android </a> website is pretty awesome because it looks clean, simple and when you scroll down there are a lot of movements. Also the devices look like they're floating.

          I recognize a lot of the basic html elements and notice that a lot of them have id's and classes.
